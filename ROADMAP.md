# Hola.nvim Development Roadmap

## Current State Analysis (Updated)

### âœ… Recently Implemented Strengths
- **Provider-based Variable Resolution System** - Supports `{{provider:identifier}}` syntax
- **OAuth 2.0 Integration** - Client credentials flow with token caching
- **HashiCorp Vault Integration** - Secure secret retrieval
- **Advanced Authentication** - Provider-based auth headers, OAuth tokens
- **Enhanced UI** - JSON formatting toggle, response/metadata view switching
- **Configuration Management** - Centralized config with provider settings
- **Virtual Text Feedback** - Real-time request status indicators

### Current Architecture
- Clean modular design with specialized components
- Async HTTP execution via plenary.curl
- Provider system: env, vault, oauth, refs
- Split window response display with syntax highlighting
- Template variable resolution across all providers

### Remaining Gaps
- **No request history or session management** (top priority)
- **Limited test coverage** - needs comprehensive test suite
- **No request chaining** between requests
- **No advanced response inspection** tools
- **No performance metrics** or timing information

## Competitive Landscape Analysis

Based on research of existing Neovim REST clients in 2024:

### Main Competitors
1. **kulala.nvim** - Most feature-rich with GraphQL, WebSocket, extensive auth methods
2. **rest.nvim** - Tree-sitter parser, pure Lua, archived but influential
3. **resty.nvim** - Telescope integration, Lua scripting hooks
4. **nvim-rest-client** - VS Code compatibility, Go backend

### Competitive Positioning
Hola.nvim should focus on **simplicity with power** - maintaining ease of use while adding essential features that developers actually need for daily API work.

## Updated Priority Features

### **HIGH PRIORITY (Core Missing Features)**

#### 1. Request History & Session Management
**Implementation:** 2-3 weeks
- Recent requests history (last 20 requests)
- Persistent history across Neovim sessions
- Request bookmarks/favorites
- Quick repeat last request functionality
- History search and filtering

**Why:** Significantly improves workflow efficiency for iterative API development.

### **MEDIUM PRIORITY (Enhanced User Experience)**

#### 2. Comprehensive Testing & Validation
**Implementation:** 3-4 weeks
- Complete test suite for all modules (utils, request, ui, dotenv)
- Request validation and schema checking
- Response assertion capabilities
- Performance benchmarking for request parsing
- Integration testing for HTTP workflows

**Why:** Ensures reliability and enables confident feature development.

#### 3. Request Chaining & Dynamic Variables
**Implementation:** 3-4 weeks
- Request chaining (use response data in subsequent requests)
- Dynamic variables (timestamps, UUIDs, random values)
- Computed variables with Lua expressions
- Response data extraction for variable assignment

**Why:** Enables complex API testing workflows and automated testing scenarios.

#### 4. Enhanced Response Analysis
**Implementation:** 2-3 weeks
- Response size indicators and performance metrics
- Copy response to clipboard functionality
- Search within response content
- Response time tracking and statistics
- Better error message display with HTTP status explanations

**Why:** Critical for debugging and performance analysis.

### **LOWER PRIORITY (Advanced Features)**

#### 7. Protocol Extensions
**Implementation:** 4-5 weeks
- GraphQL query support with syntax highlighting
- WebSocket connection testing capabilities
- File upload capabilities (multipart/form-data)
- Request streaming for large payloads
- gRPC support (if feasible)

**Why:** Expands use cases but not essential for core REST API work.

#### 8. Developer Experience Enhancements
**Implementation:** 3-4 weeks
- Auto-completion for HTTP methods and common headers
- Request templates/snippets library
- Integration with telescope.nvim for request discovery
- Export capabilities (curl commands, Postman collections)
- Request validation and linting

**Why:** Nice-to-have features that improve productivity.

#### 9. Advanced Integrations
**Implementation:** 2-3 weeks
- LSP integration for .http files
- Git integration for request versioning
- CI/CD integration helpers
- OpenAPI/Swagger import capabilities
- Mock server integration

**Why:** Professional workflow features for team environments.

### **TECHNICAL DEBT & POLISH**

#### 10. Code Quality & Performance
**Implementation:** Ongoing
- Memory management for large responses
- Async operation optimization
- Error handling improvements
- Code documentation and type annotations
- Performance profiling and optimization

**Why:** Ensures long-term maintainability and reliability.

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Features (4-6 weeks)
**Goal:** Complete the essential missing functionality
- Request History & Session Management
- Comprehensive test suite for existing provider system
- Enhanced response analysis tools
- Request chaining basics

**Success Metrics:**
- Persistent request history working reliably
- Test coverage > 80% for all modules
- Can handle complex API testing workflows

### Phase 2: Advanced Workflows (6-8 weeks)
**Goal:** Advanced API testing capabilities
- Full request chaining implementation
- Dynamic variables and computed expressions
- Advanced response analysis and metrics
- Request validation and assertions

**Success Metrics:**
- Supports automated testing workflows
- Performance metrics help with optimization
- Response analysis aids debugging

### Phase 3: Advanced (8-10 weeks)
**Goal:** Differentiate from competitors
- Protocol extensions (GraphQL, WebSocket)
- Developer experience features
- Advanced integrations
- Performance optimizations

**Success Metrics:**
- Unique features that competitors lack
- Performance matches or exceeds alternatives
- Strong ecosystem integration

## Success Criteria

### User Adoption
- GitHub stars > 100 within 6 months
- Active user feedback and feature requests
- Community contributions and plugins

### Technical Excellence
- Zero critical bugs in core functionality
- Response times < 100ms for request parsing
- Memory usage < 50MB for typical sessions

### Developer Experience
- Setup time < 5 minutes for new users
- Common workflows require < 3 commands
- Error messages are clear and actionable

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate (Next Sprint):**
   - Implement request history and session persistence
   - Set up comprehensive test framework for existing modules
   - Add response timing and performance metrics

2. **Short Term (1-2 months):**
